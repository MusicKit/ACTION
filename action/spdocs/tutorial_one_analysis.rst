Tutorial One: Setup and Analysis
********************************

Abstract
========

This tutorial will show how one performs analysis of both the audio and video in a feature-length film. It is assumed that the reader has at least some familiarity with Python or a similar coding language, i.e. Ruby, Javascript, etc. and is comfortable using the command line. These tutorials have been tested with Mac OS 10.8 and, more recently, 10.9.

Prerequisites
=============

* Python 2.7.* (2.6.* should work as well)
* Numpy, Scipy, IPython, Matplotlib, and OpenCV
* MacTheRipper, MPlayer, fftExtract, automation scripts (see below)
* A movie file, on DVD or on disc
* Terminal, or command line program on your platform of choice

This tutorial will demonstrate analysis of both the audio and video in a feature-length film using ACTION. First, we will give a high-level overview of the process, and then present detailed step-by-step instructions. It is assumed that the reader has at least some familiarity with Python or a similar coding language, i.e. Ruby, Javascript, etc. This initial version of the tutorial is based on Mac OS 10.8, but should work in earlier versions of Mac OS, as well as Windows and Linux.

Overview
========

Here are the basic steps to getting our software to work using a Mac. If you are using our metadata and do not need to set up ACTION to analyze films, you can skip steps 2-3 and 6-8.

#. Set up your Python + Numpy/Scipy/IPython/MatPlotLib/OpenCV environment. 
#. Get a DVD-to-MPEG converter like MacTheRipper or MacXDVDRipper.*
#. Get mplayer and fftExtract.*
#. Download and install ACTION and Bregman Toolkit.
#. Make a directory: ~/Movies/action.
#. Rip your DVD according to these directions. The resultant file should be placed in ~/Movies/action/DVD_TITLE.*
#. Extract audio and audio features using the audio analysis shell script. They will end up as 4 files in ~/Movies/action/DVD_TITLE.*
#. Extract video features using the video analysis Python script or by using iPython. They will end up files in ~/Movies/action/DVD_TITLE.*

This process is pretty extensive. * Note that you can skip the conversion and analysis steps (this tutorial) and proceed onto the next tutorial using data that we have extracted and made available.

Step-by-step
============

Set Up Python Environment
-------------------------
On Mac OS 10.6.8, it is highly recommended that you use `Enthought Python <https://www.enthought.com/products/epd/>`_, which includes Numpy/Scipy/IPython/MPL. Download OpenCV from `opencv.org <http://opencv.org/>`_ and install using CMake according to their instructions.

For Mac OS 10.7.* and 10.8.*, we have tested the Python version supplied by Apple: 2.7.3 (as of summer 2013). Download the Python `Scipy SuperPack <http://fonnesbeck.github.io/ScipySuperpack/>`_ for your OS version. Download OpenCV from `opencv.org <http://opencv.org/>`_ and install using CMake according to their instructions.

On Mac OS 10.8.* and 10.9.*, we have tested `MacPorts <http://macports.org>`_ Python as well as Apple's version. 

You should be able to ``import`` all the aforementioned modules successfully; if you can, you have successfully set up Python for use with ACTION.

Get Bregman and ACTION
----------------------
Download `Bregman <http://bregman.dartmouth.edu/bregman/>`_ and `ACTION <http://bregman.dartmouth.edu/~action/code.html>`_. For each: unzip the project folder somewhere in your home folder, ``cd`` into it and type ``sudo python setup.py install``. If python is set up properly, ACTION will be installed into the site_packages directory and available for use within Python the next time the terminal app is started. 

Get a DVD Ripper
----------------
MacTheRipper or some other ripper is used to create an uncompressed version of the DVD. That way, each frame is accessible for analysis, etc.

Get mplayer
-----------
`Mplayer <http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html>`_ is an app for playing video/movie files from the command line or a bash script. We use mplayer to automate audio extraction. Install it according to the directions in its README file.

Get fftExtract
--------------
Finally, download `fftExtract <http://omras2.doc.gold.ac.uk/software/fftextract/>`_. fftExtract is a C program that is called from the command line or bash script. The features that it extracts are *similar* to those extracted by the feature extraction classes in the Bregman Toolkit, but runs faster.

Locate Analysis Scripts
-----------------------
There are some analysis helper scripts in the ``scripts`` directory of ACTION. These are scripts, one written in bash and one in Python, for batching analyses. You can, of course, perform each command separately.

Make an Action Directory
------------------------
This is not technically a requirement, but simply a default. We use ~/Movies/action on Mac to organize ACTION data files. If you have a folder that you would rather use, you may pass your own path to the various Python functions.

Rip Your DVD
------------
This `document <http://bregman.dartmouth.edu/action/resourses/DVD_to_JPEG_Motion.pdf>`_ covers ripping in detail, and is the method we used to produce the actual video files used for analysis.

Extract Video
-------------
This is really the heart of ACTION. We have several types of analysis routines that take frames of video and analyze their color content (plus implicit spatial information) and optical flow.

Using the Python classes directly:

#. Move your .mov file(s) to ~/Movies/action/DVD_TITLE, or to your preferred location. For each movie, the folder with the standardized title should contain the .mov file (copy it to there) and will be where ACTION writes all data files. Either in IPython or in a Python script, these are the basic steps:

#. ``from action.suite import *`` 
#. Create a ColorFeaturesLAB object: ``cflab = ColorFeaturesLAB(TITLE)`` where ``TITLE`` is the standardized title string for the film (without any extension).
#. Call ``cflab.analyze_histogram_for_movie()``. You can also try ``cflab.analyze_color_features_for_movie_with_display()`` to see a visualization of the analysis data as the process runs.
#. Wait for analysis to complete. You will have the L*a*b* color features analysis file in your action movies folder alongside MOVIE.mov. The extension is ``.color_lab``.
#. Carry out the same steps for additional analysis classes. Each class implements one type of feature extraction.

Using our batch Python script:

#. Move your .mov file(s) to ~/Movies/action, or to your preferred location. For each movie, there should be a single folder with the standardized title that contains the .mov file. This directory will be where ACTION writes all data files.
#. Launch Terminal and ``cd`` to the directory with your analysis scripts.
#. Call ``python  batch_analyze_video-threaded ACTION_DIR NUM_PROCS``. This will run your video analysis in a batch mode. You should set ``ACTION_DIR`` to ~/Movies/action/ or whatever you used (see above). Set ``NUM_PROCS`` to the number of simultaneous processes to use.
#. Sit back and let bash do all the work. Your video analysis data will reside in files alongside your .mov files in the movies' directories.

Please see ``scripts/batch_analyze_audio_48000.sh`` in the code repository.


Extract Audio
-------------

We use mplayer to extract the raw audio data from the movie file, and then use fftExtract to extract spectral data: Short Term Fourier Transform (STFT), Constant-Q Fourier Transform (CQFT), Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC), Chroma, and Power. fftExtract, a command-line program, is simply a similar version of the same analysis tools found in the Bregman Toolkit, but coded in C, and able to handle a whole WAVE file from a feature-length film.

Using Bregman for audio analysis : you can find `general information about Bregman <http://bregman.dartmouth.edu/bregman>`_ which includes tutorials for various tasks.

Using fftExtract:

#. Move your .mov file(s) to ~/Movies/action, or to your preferred location. For each movie, there should be a folder with the standardized title that contains the .mov file and will be where ACTION writes all data files.
#. Launch Terminal and ``cd`` to the directory with your analysis scripts. If you just performed video analysis, you should already be in that directory.
#. Call ``sh ./batch_analyze_audio_48000.sh``.
#. Sit back and let bash do the work. Your audio analysis data will reside in four files alongside your .mov file in the movies directory. There will also be a .wav file created. You are free to throw it away.


Using the Data
==============

Now that you have all this data, it's time to use it for something. The `next tutorial <tutorial_two_access.html>`_ will cover access and really simple uses of the video and audio data produced in this tutorial.
